* Allows removals of supervision elements

== How to use?

=== Online Using the Latest open-scd-core

==== Using a URL

Open SCD core allows plugins to be loaded from a URL.

You can click on {uri-openscd-core-plugin}[this link] to trial this plugin.

In this view it is without theming and only presents this plugin along with the open and save plugins.

==== Manually

. The latest core is available at {uri-openscd-core-app}.

. Go to menu:Menu[Add plugins...]

. Select Cancel - this is an editor plugin.

. Select OK to required a loaded document.

. Choose a plugin name of '{plugin-name}'.

. Choose a plugin icon of 'link'

. Provide a plugin source URI of: {uri-ci-bundle}

. Click OK on the summary, it should indicate the parameters previously entered.

. Open a file and enjoy!

=== Locally for testing

. Clone this project:
+
[subs=+attributes]
....
$ git clone {uri-plugin}
....

. Install dependencies

  $ npm i

. Start up a demo server 

  $ npm run start

. Open in your browser locally at http://localhost:8000/demo/

=== As part of the OpenSCD distribution

TIP: OpenSCD is transitioning to use of `open-scd-core`, these instructions will require updating at the end of this transition.

// TODO: Is this fixed yet?
IMPORTANT: Currently the reactive update cycle in OpenSCD doesn't optimally support this plugin's behaviour -- it scrolls to the top of lists after a subscription is made or one of the window panes may go blank. This is a known issue and under investigation.

. Open your OpenSCD distribution or use {uri-openscd-app}.

. Create a custom extension by going to menu:menu[Extensions>Add Custom Extension].

. Enter the name '{plugin-name}', select 'Editor tab' and enter {uri-ci-bundle} as the URL.
+
This is the URL of the bundle built by CI and is always the latest pre-release version of this plugin.
+
.OpenSCD Add Custom Extension Screen
image::screenshot-add-extension.png[width=300]

. Click on menu:Add[].

. Until OpenSCD is fully transitioned to open-scd-core, a conversion plugin is also required to interface between the old and new APIs.

. Create another custom extension by going to menu:menu[Extensions>Add Custom Extension].

. Enter the name 'Action Translate', select 'Menu entry' and enter {uri-action-translate-ci-bundle} as the URL.
+
This is the URL of the bundle built by CI and is always the latest pre-release version of this plugin.

. You should now be able to scroll across in the menu-bar and find a tab, "{plugin-name}"
+
TIP: If there are too many editor plugin, hold down shift and wheel-mouse up and down to scroll them easily.

=== As part of your own distribution

==== Within the current OpenSCD distribution

. Within the current OpenSCD distribution, plugins are stored in the `public/js/plugins.js` folder. 
Each plugin appears in the following form:
+
[source,js,subs=+attributes]
----
{
    name: '{plugin-name}', // <.>
    src: '{uri-ci-bundle}', //  <.>
    icon: 'ecg', // <.>
    default: true, // <.>
    kind: 'editor', // <.>
    requireDoc: true, // <.>
    position: 'middle' // <.>
  }
----
<.> Name of the plugin which appears in the editor menu at top of screen
<.> URL which can be a local or remote resource. 
For a local resource, begins without a forward slash, e.g. `plugins/oscd-supervision/dist/oscd-supervision.js`. 
In this case what is shown is loading a plugin from the build process.
<.> A material icon, see others at {uri-material-icons}[Material Symbols and Icons]
<.> Whether the plugin is enabled by default or has to be enabled in the plugins menu
<.> The type of plugin, either `menu` or `editor`. This is an `editor` plugin.
<.> Whether a document must be loaded for this plugin to be available
<.> A string, either `top`, `middle` or `bottom` to give a location in the menu. 
Otherwise inferred from the order in the file relative to other plugins.

. You need to copy an entry like the above, ensure the `src` URL resolves and the plugin should be loaded when the distribution is built.

. If you are building locally you likely need to run an `npm run bundle` command in each plugin to make the `dist` folder, containing a single JavaScript file with the plugin available to OpenSCD.

==== Within an OpenSCD core distribution

Within an OpenSCD core distribution, plugins are also loaded from a json file with a slightly different schema.

. Typically the distribution will be served from a static web page and within the web page there will be a plugins property declared on an `open-scd` object, for instance:
+
[source,js,subs=+attributes]
----
include::demo/index.html[tag=plugins]
----

. This plugin is an editor plugin, editor plugins are an array of JSON of the following form:
+
[source,js,subs=+attributes]
----
{
  "name": "{plugin-name}", // <.>
  "translations": { // <.>
    "de": "Überwachung", 
    "pt":"Supervisão"
  },
  "icon": "link", // <.>
  "active": true, // <.>
  "requireDoc": true, // <.>
  "src": "/dist/oscd-supervision.js" // <.>
}
----
<.> Name of the plugin which appears in the editor menu at top of screen
<.> Translations of the plugin name as required using standard locale names.
<.> A material icon, see others at {uri-material-icons}[Material Symbols and Icons]
<.> Whether the plugin is enabled by default or has to be enabled in the plugins menu
<.> Whether a document must be loaded for this plugin to be available
<.> URL which can be a local or remote resource. 
For a local resource, begins with a forward slash, e.g. `plugins/oscd-supervision/dist/oscd-supervision.js`. 
In this case what is shown is loading a plugin from the internet using the continuous integration build process.

. You need to copy an entry like the above, ensure the `src` URL resolves and the plugin should be loaded when the distribution is built.

. If you are building locally you likely need to run an `npm run bundle` command in each plugin to make the `dist` folder, containing a single JavaScript file with the plugin available to OpenSCD.

== Development

=== Linting and formatting

To scan the project for linting and formatting errors, run

[source,bash]
----
npm run lint
----

To automatically fix linting and formatting errors, run

[source,bash]
----
npm run format
----

=== Testing with Web Test Runner

To execute a single test run:

[source,bash]
----
npm run test
----

To run the tests in interactive watch mode run:

[source,bash]
----
npm run test:watch
----

=== Tooling configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to reduce the number of files in your project.

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.

=== Local Demo with `web-dev-server`

To run a local development server that serves the basic demo located in `demo/index.html`

[source,bash]
----
npm start
----
