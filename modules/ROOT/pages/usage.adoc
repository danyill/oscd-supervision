The first supervision cannot be deleted as it is required to maintain the integrity of the references.

== Searching Supervisions and Control Blocks

If connecting many supervisions and control blocks, the search bar can be used on the lower part of the screen
Search is case-sensitive and multiple terms can be used.
To search, enter text in the search field.

Common searches include

* supervision or control block description (from descriptions in the SCL file)
* supervision node (e.g. `"LGOS 1"` or `'LGOS 1'`)
* control block name (e.g. `TripCBFail`)

== Descriptions

The plugin allows descriptions to be provided for supervision nodes and control blocks.
These are typically shown under the supervision name and instance.

* The `desc` field on the `LDevice`, `LLN0` or `GSEControl` -- these are joined together with a caret, e.g. `LDevice desc > Some LLN0 desc > Some GSE desc`
* The `desc` field on the `LDevice`, or supervision `LN` or the value of the `desc` attribute on the `St` `DOI` or the `DAI[d]` on the `DOI` (if `desc` is not available)
