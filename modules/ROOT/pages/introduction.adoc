The Supervision plugin provides the following capabilities

* Creating and deleting supervision nodes (LGOS and LSVS)
* Adding and removing control block references to supervision nodes

== Overview

The plugin consists of two sections:

* Referenced supervisions with their control blocks
* Free supervisions and control blocks

== Requirements

The plugin will only allow modifications to supervision nodes if the SCL file allows them (see xref:allowing_supervision_modifications.adoc[] for more details and how to carry out manual modification).

This is known to work with typical templates for:

* Siemens DIGSI 5 for SIPROTEC 5 devices (LGOS and LSVS nodes)
* GE Enervista UR Setup (for Multilin devices and LGOS nodes)
* SEL SEL-24xx, SEL-751, SEL-4xx devices when manually configured.
* NR Electric PCS-221S when manually configured.

For creating supervision nodes, the `Services` section of the IED must be declared

[source,xml]
----
<Services nameLength="64">
  <SupSubscription
    maxGo="128" <--.-->
    maxSv="60"/> <--.-->
</Services>
----
<.> 128 LGOS supervisions allowed
<.> 60 LSVS supervisions allowed
